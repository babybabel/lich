INSPIRATION

For this class's final project, I wanted to make something adequately cool to cap off the semester. To do this, I would really have to think about the kind of project I would want to spend a lot of time working on. After a week went by since hearing about the assignment, I finally came to three ideas, that would address the "community" aspect in some way or another:
1) A choose your own adventure game where you escape from a lich's labyrinth, made for people who are trapped in a maze
2) A dating sim where you date a guy, made for people who want to date a guy but on the computer
And then I put them together:
3) A dating sim where you date a lich after escaping from his labyrinth, for people who would want to date and evil lich who's after you

I wasn't confident something like this would be allowed, but after getting the go-ahead, I was eager to start working on this project and making something really cool and cute.

DESIGN PROCESS

Working on this took a lot of time. Making the functionality, writing the 10-page long script with all the different dialogue options, designing and modelling our lich boyfriend, and then, creating 10 unique pre-rendered stills to accompany the events of each page, all hosted in a frame. I spent a lot of hours on this project.

The design process for the lich began in 2D. I wanted him to look stylized, making his "evil" features prominent, like his horns and small eyes, but then cutifying him and making him endearing, with his crop top robe, horn piercings, shorts, and socks and sandals. A fun trick for skeletal characters is playing with the eyes: his pink "pupil" is just a shape set in the black socket, which means that it can be made into any other shape to emphasize expression without actually making the skull emote too much. For example, if we want him to be blinking/squinting, we'd squish the pupil into - instead of an |. 

Then came making the starbucks scene behind him. I wanted it to be simple and be carried mostly by its color choices, keeping the lich prominent in each frame: dark purples, white and mint green accents would keep him dominant with his bright white-pink skin and dark green robe.

Since the localstorage choices only affect his response to you and not the actual event of the next page, I had to make the choices all place you in the uniform place of the page sequence. This wasn't a true choose your own adventure, its more like a choose your own backtalk. I was scared that this would make the player feel robbed of agency and frustrated that no matter what they did, it always ended up the same. My silly justification was that when encountering an evil powerful lich, you really have no agency. My real justification is that I didn't know how to write a script that would account for all your cumulative choices and land you in a particularly result. 

EXECUTION

I'm pretty satisfied with how this turned out. It's short, cute, and super simple. It's not perfect-- I wish each pre-render frame could have a little more character to them and have the lich be more expressive, and I wish there were actual end-game responses to your choices, not just a dialogue response. Time is the major enemy for these kinds of things though and I didn't have an infinite amount with all the work I was already putting into this.

I sincerely hope you enjoyed this project and appreciate everything I did to make it special. Thank you!
