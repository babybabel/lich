                <input type="radio" name="myRadios" class="radio" value="<q>Um, that guy's been dead for a really long time. Also I stole his bones and reanimated him to be my Grand Clerical Magistrate so his 'will' is to book my appointments and make reservations for me.</q>" /> "By the will of Pope Aristus V, return to ash!"<br>
